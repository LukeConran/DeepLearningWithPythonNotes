# DeepLearningWithPythonNotes

This repository contains notes, worked examples, and small experiments for *Deep Learning with Python*, implemented with Keras/TensorFlow in Jupyter notebooks. It is designed to keep track of my learning for studying deep learning concepts in Python from the book.

## Contents

- Jupyter notebooks
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
- The used data can be found from the book

## Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts:

### Using pip (venv)
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
